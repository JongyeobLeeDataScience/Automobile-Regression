# Automobile Regerssion

## Goals
Using sample automobile dataset, different regression tests were used to determine the optimal model

## Models
To determine the optimal model, the following regression models are studied:

    1. Linear Regression Model; 
    2. Lasso Regression Model; 
    3. Ridge Regression Model;
    4. Elastic Net Regression Model;
